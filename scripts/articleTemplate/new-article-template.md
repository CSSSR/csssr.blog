Promo description of the article

---

**For** a quick start, you can look at already created articles.

## {{slug}}

All pictures of an article are stored in its pictures folder here `public/posts/{{slug}}`
and connected by name of the images folder.

It is obligatory to have mainCoverS (small picture for main page), mainCoverL (big picture for main page) and postCover (picture in article header) pictures.
The generator has already created a stub for those images and also for the image mySampleImage,
which you can see below:

<Img imageName='mySampleImage' alt='Don't forget to specify alt!' />

End of article.
