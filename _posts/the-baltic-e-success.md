**E**stonia enjoys the reputation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;genuinely digital society. Today, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;Europe’s most ambitious country in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;technological and&nbsp;IT development. Most of&nbsp;government services are delivered 24/7 and have been digitally linked across one platform, while blockchain technology is&nbsp;often used to&nbsp;secure data integrity. Estonia has the largest number of&nbsp;IT startups per capita, while the alumni of&nbsp;two leading Universities are behind the world-famous tech companies that have changed the market. Let’s have a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the numbers that make the country claim it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the real E-success and&nbsp;IT leader.

## Europe’s most developed IT sector

Estonia is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the smallest European countries with a&nbsp;population of&nbsp; [1,3 million people](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/estonia-population/). However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;well known for its enormous contribution to&nbsp;the mass adoption and development of&nbsp;various&nbsp;IT solutions. Estonian IT&nbsp;industry, despite its comparatively small share in&nbsp;the global market, has certain well-developed segments. The overall contribution of&nbsp;the national&nbsp;IT sector to&nbsp;the country’s GDP is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;4%.

The emerging strengths of&nbsp;Estonian IT&nbsp;industry include numerous technological solutions offered to&nbsp;the companies and organizations operating in&nbsp;the financial, governmental and cyber security sectors. As&nbsp;of&nbsp;the mid-2017, Estonia had [almost 23](https://outsourcingreview.org/it-outsourcing-markets-review-estonia-vs-ukraine/)&nbsp;thousand of&nbsp;IT professionals, a&nbsp;relatively large number for a&nbsp;small European state. Today, the country’s IT&nbsp;market is&nbsp;receiving an&nbsp;increasing attention from both tech specialists and companies.

What makes Estonia progressive are the governmental initiatives aimed at&nbsp;the extended use of&nbsp;its developing&nbsp;IT industry. Everything is&nbsp;being turned electronic&nbsp;– legislation, voting, education, healthcare, banking, justice, tax systems, etc. E-Residency, a&nbsp;digital platform launched by&nbsp;the Estonian government 5&nbsp;years ago, is&nbsp;possibly the best known example. Through this platform, residents of&nbsp;other countries get access to&nbsp;a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;government services provided to&nbsp;domestic population.

In&nbsp;2019, Estonia is&nbsp;anticipated to&nbsp;issue [the first visa for “digital nomads”](https://e-estonia.com/digital-nomads-visa-shape-urban-employment/), allowing top talents from around Europe, and beyond, to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;business and working opportunities for 12&nbsp;months. By&nbsp;now, Estonia has shared its e-governance experience with [60 governments](https://e-estonia.com/it-sector/) and exported its solutions to&nbsp;over 130 countries worldwide.

## The ambitious startup community

Digital society has also fostered a&nbsp;culture of&nbsp;innovative tech companies. The country’s ambitious startup community has turned Estonia into one of&nbsp;the top countries that have the most established startups (from Fintech to&nbsp;Greentech and beyond) per capita than anywhere else in&nbsp;Europe.

According to&nbsp;statistics from the [Estonian Tax and Customs Board](https://www.emta.ee/eng), in&nbsp;2018, Estonian startups [employed 3763](https://www.startupestonia.ee/blog/2018-records-for-the-estonian-startup-sector-new-wave-of-entrepreneurs-in-the-community) specialists in&nbsp;their offices in&nbsp;Estonia, an&nbsp;increase of&nbsp;26% compared to&nbsp;2981 people in&nbsp;2017. Same year, the annual turnover generated by&nbsp;the Estonian startups has reached €299&nbsp;million, which is&nbsp;9% above the 2017 level (€275&nbsp;million).

In&nbsp;2018, the total investments attracted by&nbsp;the Estonian startups have reached almost €328&nbsp;million. The largest investment so&nbsp;far (€150&nbsp;million) was made into [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/ru/) (one of&nbsp;Uber’s competitors), then followed by&nbsp;[Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) (€43 million + €8,7&nbsp;million), [Monese](https://monese.com/) (€51,6&nbsp;million) and [Starship Technologies](https://www.starship.xyz/) (€21,4&nbsp;million).

At&nbsp;the moment, there are [4800 IT companies](https://e-estonia.com/it-sector/) doing business in&nbsp;Estonia that can be&nbsp;segmented by&nbsp;three core types: purely Estonian; Estonian eventually becoming international (local startups that attracted foreign investments); purely international.

## At the top of tax competitiveness rating

Another attractive thing about Estonia is&nbsp;the progressive and competitive tax system. Startups allocating investments to&nbsp;the growth and development of&nbsp;the company, are authorized to&nbsp;pay&nbsp;0% taxes. This initiative seeks to&nbsp;develop private businesses and stimulates the inflow of&nbsp;small and medium enterprises to&nbsp;the country. In&nbsp;2019, Estonia reached the highest position in&nbsp;the rating of&nbsp;the world’s most competitive tax systems released by&nbsp;[The International Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/2019-international-index/).

The score in&nbsp;the given index was achieved through a&nbsp;20% corporate profit tax (applied to&nbsp;distributed profits only), a&nbsp;20% tax on&nbsp;individual income (not applying to&nbsp;personal dividend income), and a&nbsp;property tax applied to&nbsp;the land’s value only. Foreign profits earned by&nbsp;local companies are also exempted from the profit taxation.

## Homegrown IT minds and scholars

Most professionals employed in&nbsp;the Estonian IT&nbsp;field are the graduates from the University of&nbsp;Tartu (UT) or&nbsp;the Tallin Tech University (TalTech), while TalTech’s School of&nbsp;Information Technologies is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;around&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;all Estonian IT&nbsp;students.

Scientists from the&nbsp;UT specialize in&nbsp;deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptography, etc. The UT&nbsp;alumni are behind the global tech companies, like [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) (video chatting service), [Playtech](http://www.playtech.ee/?nav=index&lang=en) (gaming industry’s leading software supplier), [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/) (money-transfer service) and [JRebel](https://www.jrebel.com/) (a&nbsp;software company).

TalTech is&nbsp;active exploring software development, computing systems design, biorobotics and biomedical engineering, cybersecurity. Scholars from TalTech have founded companies like [Testonica Lab](http://testonica.com/) (electronics manufacturing), [Optofluid Technologies](https://www.funderbeam.com/startups/optofluid-technologies) (online sensors for dialysis machines), [Guardtime](https://guardtime.com/) (cybersecurity solutions).

## Just the beginning

Surely, the way to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;digital society in&nbsp;Estonia was challenging. In&nbsp;2007, the state suffered a&nbsp;severe cyber attack which has affected and almost completely disabled some segments of&nbsp;its digital infrastructure. There were many other challenges the government has wrestled to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;tiny Baltic country one of&nbsp;the most tech-savvy societies in&nbsp;the world. Estonia has undertaken a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;reforms designed to&nbsp;guarantee a&nbsp;complete modernization of&nbsp;a&nbsp;national economy. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;its commitment to&nbsp;innovation, you can use medical e-prescriptions, file taxes, or&nbsp;even buy a&nbsp;car online.

The country now represents a&nbsp;benchmark of&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-built digital society. Some say, that Estonia is&nbsp;running its country like a&nbsp;tech company. True. Yet, this is&nbsp;just the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long journey, as&nbsp;more tech companies from Estonia are exploring the most trendy technical segments, with Big Data, AI, AR/VR and cyber security among others.

Outsourcing is&nbsp;another trend to&nbsp;follow as&nbsp;it&nbsp;opens new ways to&nbsp;eliminate weaknesses of&nbsp;in-house project development. [Outsourcing in the IT world](https://loremscriptum.com/#about) has proved extremely popular due to&nbsp;its economic advantages, and Estonia is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;exception in&nbsp;this respect. As&nbsp;the national&nbsp;IT sector grows, the country will need more professional&nbsp;IT talents, including back-end and front-end developers, computer and data scientists, top JavaScript specialists, etc.
