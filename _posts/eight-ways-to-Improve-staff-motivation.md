##Know your enemy: what causes demotivation?

There are multiple factors that cause workplace demotivation. The key reason so far is the relationship between managers and their teams. As seen from the suggested points below, this is the biggest root cause of this transformation driving the people’s morale down.

### Feeling undervalued and useless

Your teammates always want to know that their efforts are valued and recognised. When they’re consistently performing and get no appreciation or recognition, employees start wondering, ‘what’s that all about’, nobody cares and notices anyway.

  ### Working without purpose
  <p>Living without goals or intent may be the biggest reason to feel demotivated. No purpose means no sense of direction, when things are done just for the sake of doing things, instead of working towards something desirable. This sense of direction often comes from a company vision. If your employees do not connect to the vision, they will not understand how they contribute to reaching it.</p>

### Personal circumstances

There’s a life outside work, and there are innumerable events that can happen and impact a employees’ behaviour. Never expect that everyone will share their problems openly at workplace.

### Goals are too big

Your goals can also be a source of your current motivation problem. If they’re too large and vague, this might likely create the unrealistic workload that your employees will not handle. The excessive workload along with expecting too much from the team cause frustration and anxiety and can negatively affect the well-being and health of your employees.

### Broken trust level

Lack of trust decreases the speed and productivity of the team and increases the costs. Trust level breaks if a manager fails to keep his promises and commitments, which apply to promotion or other promised benefits, including advance of wages. If you are not delegating tasks because you believe only you can do them correctly, communicates a lack of trust as well.

<ParagraphWithImage imageName="menbla">
  <p>Poor time management can cause a wide range of problems such as inefficient time allocation, distraction and procrastination. Employees who don’t have control over their time end up letting tasks sit until the last minute, a lot of stress when they try to play catch up and finally miss the deadlines entirely.</p>

### No development or/and career opportunities

Most employees are eager to develop, learn and grow. However, the opportunities to develop skills and expertise may be missing, which causes a team member to feel frustrated as he knows that he could have bring more value to the team.

Absence of career opportunities shadows the motivation and profession goals of your teammates. If a team leader doesn’t show the way their efforts can affect their career pump, this will definitely lead to demotivation.

<Note>
#### Dangers: what is the impact of a demotivated employee?

There’s one more thing you should consider if/when facing the problem. The demotivated employees are often distracted, and they start distracting and frustrating those around them affecting negatively the general working atmosphere inside the team. If they have a client-facing position, then the problem may have a killing impact on your relationship with both the existing and potential customers.
