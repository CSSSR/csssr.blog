Aside from geographical location and time differences, outsourcing destinations are usually characterized by numerous criteria: tech-literacy and qualification, service costs, communication skills, legal and intellectual property protection, etc. East European countries, like Ukraine and Russia, are well known for being the top destinations for web development outsourcing services in Singapore. Their Asian contenders are India, Indonesia, China and Vietnam. Read on to find out their pros and cons.

<ParagraphWithImage imageName="india">
  ## India

  <p>India is one of the top choices for web development outsourcing globally. Nowadays, it is the world’s second-largest English-speaking country with mature IT industry, developed IT infrastructure, educated urban population and a huge number of IT professionals.</p>

  <p>Indian companies offer various solutions and services, ranging from system migration, maintenance and integration, to web and application development, while the biggest advantage associated with web development outsourcing to India is low pricing. An average hourly rate for a web developer in India is extremely low.</p>

  <p>Still, outsourcing to India is a controversial issue since Indian contractors are very different, and you can never predict what quality level you will get. In certain cases, customers have to re-order services due to code imperfection. The code can contain numerous bugs, which are difficult or even impossible to fix, and cannot be further maintained and developed. Some of the best Indian web development enterprises can deliver good results. Yet, the finest quality always requires the best and the most expensive workforce, which affects the overall pricing.</p>

  ## China

  <p>China is the second most popular web development outsourcing destination behind India. The country is a powerhouse for math science both in primary and high schools, resulting in many young specialists obtaining high-quality programming skills. Chinese IT companies provide Singapore outsourcers comparatively fine code quality and a lower cost option for their web development services.</p>

  <p>However, the wages of Chinese web developers are increasing, which makes the pricing higher than the rest of Asia. Besides, despite the high overall literacy rate in China, the number of English speaking people is still low which can create a certain communication barrier. Yet another weakness of the local market is China’s discretion on intellectual property. This can lead to code ownership and updating issues if not previously discussed or legally secured.</p>

  ## Indonesia

  <p>India is one of the top choices for web development outsourcing globally. Nowadays, it is the world’s second-largest English-speaking country with mature IT industry, developed IT infrastructure, educated urban population and a huge number of IT professionals.</p>

  ## Vietnam

  <p>Modern-day Vietnam is a country continuously growing to become one of the most prominent destinations on the web development outsourcing market. Two factors have normally contributed to that: skilled and productive labor force plus low costs. Both are making Vietnam a powerful IT hub and a front-runner in this offshore outsourcing race among the Asian countries.</p>

  <p>As experienced Vietnamese developers came back from abroad, bringing their knowledge back home, the quality of web development services in Vietnam increases. On the other hand, lack of expertise in code reviewing and QA engineering creates a gap, that outsourcers have to cover.</p>

<ParagraphWithImage imageName="europe">
  ## Eastern Europe

  <p>Eastern Europe also ranks as the leading and promising destination for web development outsourcing with Ukraine and Russia being the top choices.Ukraine is gaining popularity as an outsourcing country that has plenty of skilled tech talents and engineering expertise. With relatively low hourly rates, Ukrainian companies deliver a wide range of web development outsourcing services, including turnkey solutions.</p>

  <p>Web developers and engineers from Poland and Bulgaria also demonstrate good professional skills and are able to produce fine code quality, good testing services and ongoing support. Both countries attract tech students from all over Europe and excel at high web development, QA and usability standards.</p>

  <p>Countries such as Belarus, and, most commonly, Russia are becoming widely recognized for their sustainable tech growth and adoption of the latest IT technologies. Russian web development companies got used to follow global trends making a strong emphasis on web development: front-end skills, Java, Ruby and PHP programming are well-established areas contributing to the increasing number of successful web projects there. That is why more companies from Asia (China, South Korea, Singapore) and Western Europe tend to export their web development and programming services to Russian enterprises.</p>

  ## Summary

  <p>Offshore web development is an important IT segment: it costs less, there are more talents available, and they are often more qualified than locals. Singapore clearly lacks IT talents to address the growing needs of its IT industry and chooses to outsource  web development offshore. Today the national IT market is characterized by the rising demand for professional tech teams that can handle numerous tasks and reduce spending.</p>

  <p>Steadily playing a bigger role in the offshore web development segment, Eastern Europe is turning into a more cost-effective alternative compared to the Asian-Pacific region. Moreover it rightfully boasts a higher quality-price ratio.  Eastern Europe does provide the best IT infrastructure, code and service quality, data protection, at costs competitive to that of Asian countries like India, China, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>

  <p>The downside of working with Asian (especially Indian or Chinese) companies is that sometimes there are  no guarantees as to the work’s quality provided. Other frequent problems with offshore contractors can include lack of non-local customers’ legal protection, difficulty to get justice in the local courts, bureaucracy, documentation or even tax issues. The best way out of that is to have a Singapore local contractor with an advanced chain of offshore web developers. CSSSR PTE. LTD., being local headquarters of international web developers mostly domiciled in Russia and Eastern Europe, can serve as the best choice  in this regard. The company can address the specific demands of local customers, offer custom-built solutions, and offer at the same time the highest quality combined with highly competitive pricing.</p>
